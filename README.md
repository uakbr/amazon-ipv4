# Amazon Web Services IPV4 Count
Simple script that counts the number of IP4 addresses owned by AWS.
* Copy, paste, and run:

```py
import urllib.request
import json

with urllib.request.urlopen(' https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json') as f:
    j = json.loads(f.read().decode('utf-8'))

print('All keys', j.keys())

print('IPV4 prefixes', len(j['prefixes']))

ips = 0
for prefix in j['prefixes']:
    cidr = int(prefix['ip_prefix'].split('/')[1])
    ips += 2**(32-cidr)

print('# IPS', ips)
```

* This is only possible because Amazon [publishes](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) their entire set of IP addresses as JSON.

* The script I wrote downloads the JSON file, converts the IPV4 CIDR block ranges to individual IP address amounts and then sums all ranges. Thus, we arrive at a grand total of: 

    * **109,847,486** IPV4 addresses owned by AWS! [As of 13 December 2020]

* Given that there are a total of **4,294,967,296** IPV4 addresses possible; this comes out to **2.55%** of all IPV4 addresses.

* Just to showcase the *sheer magnitude* of how many more IPV6 addresses exist: there's a total of (2^128) addresses, allowing 3.4 x 10^38 unique IP addresses. This is equal to **340 trillion trillion trillion IPV6 addresses**. 

The below data is provided by: [IPV4 Market](https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/)
Disclaimer: I have not had the time to yet corroborate IPV4 Market's market data itself; I am not saying it is wrong but I would also seek multiple sources if possible.

## How much are AWS IPV4's worth cumulatively? 

Price variations over time and by deal size

You can observe how the market reached a plateau at $15 per IP for several months in 2017, but then accelerated rapidly to $18 per IP. A new plateau at $20 per IP was reached between March and December of 2019, but prices since the start of 2020 have again started to climb.

## Global Size of the IPv4 Market Place
### Number of IPs transferred each year

The chart above shows the IPs transferred through the RIRâ€™s on a global basis. Total volume is driven by large transfers, consisting of /12s and larger. This has plateaued at almost 70 million IPs transferred each year from 2017 to 2019.
